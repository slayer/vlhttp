    Compiling elhttp
    ----------------

        . under Linux or *BSD, run "make linux"

        . under SunOS (Solaris), run "make sunos"

        . under OSF / HP-UX / IRIX, run "make unix"

        . under Windows, open elhttp.dsp with VC++
          and select Build->Rebuild All. You can
          also use the pre-compiled binary.


    Program usage
    -------------

        [+] Inetd  mode : add in /etc/inetd.conf

        webcache stream tcp nowait nobody /usr/local/bin/elhttp
        elhttp 0 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 /var/tmp/elhttp.log 1

        [+] Daemon mode (default) :

            elhttp [proxy port] [authorized ip] [network mask]
                   [logfile] [CONNECT method flag]

        Example:

        elhttp  3128  192.168.1.0  255.255.255.0  proxy_log.txt  1

        Default parameters:

                port = 8208
             auth_ip = 0.0.0.0
             netmask = 0.0.0.0
             logfile = ""
             connect = 2

            * if connect = 0 : CONNECT method not allowed.

            * if connect = 1 : CONNECT method allowed to remote
                               port 443 (https) only.

            * if connect > 1 : CONNECT method allowed to any
                               port without restrictions.

        These default parameters are not secure: everyone has access
        to the proxy, no logging is done and the http CONNECT method
        is enabled. It is thus highly recommended to setup more res-
        trictive parameters when starting elhttp.
